# Dart Extension Methods

Dart extension methods allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code. This feature is useful for enhancing built-in types and third-party libraries efficiently.

## Why Use Extension Methods?
- Add methods to existing classes without inheritance.
- Keep code clean and organized.
- Improve readability and maintainability.

## Syntax
To define an extension method, use the `extension` keyword followed by the extension name and `on` keyword with the target type:

```dart
extension CapitalizeString on String {
  String capitalize() {
    if (isEmpty) return this;
    return this[0].toUpperCase() + substring(1);
  }
}

void main() {
  String text = "hello";
  print(text.capitalize()); // Output: Hello
}
```

## How to Use
1. Import the Dart file containing the extension.
2. Call the extension method as if it were a built-in method.

## Searching for Dart Extensions
- **Dart SDK Docs**: [Dart API Documentation](https://api.dart.dev/)
- **Pub.dev**: Search for relevant packages [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
- **GitHub**: Use advanced search `extension in:file language:dart`

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful names for extensions.
- Keep extensions relevant to the target type.
- Avoid conflicts by placing extensions in specific namespaces.

## Conclusion
Dart extension methods are a powerful feature to enhance existing classes without modifying their source code. They offer a clean and efficient way to extend functionality while keeping code readable and maintainable.
